      Text: 'The Robots Exclusion Protocol is a protocol, in which the website owner can give instructions to web-crawlers. Web-crawlers are programms that search the web, for example the google search engine. For the protocoll, we set up a robots.txt file. The programm will search it and hopefully recognice it. <br>In our case, we told the robot to not enter the "contact.html" page, or the folder "pictures". To use it, you can simply insert the file into your root folder.<br> <a href="./robots.txt">To see the file click here.</a> <br>When you implement a file like this, you should always remember, that this is not a real protection. Crawlers can simply be programmed to ignore the order.'
