If you want to send an Email anonymously there are a few different methods.

<h3>Using false Names</h3>
When you sign into a new mail account, for example Gmail, there is often just limited verification about your identity. What would hinder us to use a wrong username?
It’s not that simple. Your Email Service still knows who you are, either by your IP address, or your email client which you have installed on your Computer. 

<h3>Specialised Services</h3>
There are a few services on the Internet, which offer an email Account without registration, for example ProtonMail. You can access these over the normal internet or over the darknet.
Some of these offer real mail accounts, others offer “throwaway” accounts, which are just temporary.

There are a few ways to achieve anonymity beside Email.

<h3>Using a Chat program that does not involve registration/ Use false names</h3>
In times of twitter shit storms and YouTube hate-comments, some people could think that they are anonymous on the Internet. No one knows their real name, and they can say whatever they want. 
So it would seem. In reality, you are not anonymous. The owner of that service still knows exactly where you are and, in some cases, even who you are. Your IP-address reveals you at any time and tracking can connect your activities on the net to your Profile. 
Pseudonym != Anonymity
We see, it’s not enough to just give false information if you can still be tracked by your address.

<h3>Using a VPN</h3>
To solve this problem, we could use a VPN service. A VPN is a server that will redirect your traffic to the targeted service. For the service it looks like all the traffic belongs to the VPN, even if it is yours. 
Have we achieved anonymity now? Well, it depends. 
If we only wanted to achieve anonymity to the service we are using, we are pretty close. 
There are still ways to track you, even if you use a VPN, but it’s much harder to do so. 
If we wanted to achieve total anonymity, we are not safer than before. The VPN still knows everything about our traffic, so we have to trust him not to give this information to anyone else.

<h3>Tor Net</h3>
To solve this Problem, the Tor network (also known as Tor Net) was designed. 
Tor is short for “The Onion Project” and was originally designed by the US government. Famous through politics and media, its maybe the most known network in the world. Today it is run by a non-profit organisation and the community.
The Tor-Net ensures anonymity by rerouting any traffic over many different tor servers. Any server just knows the next server in line and the last one. If your targeted service is based outside of the Tor-Net, the traffic will exit the network by using so called Tor-Exit points. 
The targeted service can only see that the traffic came from the Tor-Net, but not its original source.

To use the Tor Net you can simply use the Tor-browser, which will redirect your traffic through the network. Also, this is the only way to access the Web-services based inside the Tor Net. The Browser is full of additional Add-ons which will help you to stay anonymous.

As good as the Tor net is, it still has some flaws. Tor does only protect against traffic analysis, not against traffic confirmation. If you control enough access Points, an organisation could analyse the packets that go in and out of the network and resolve your identity. 

<h3>A Basic Problem – Meta data </h3>
Even if we find the perfect way to protect our communication, we still don’t get the perfect anonymity. 
When we use a web-service we always leave some information in the form of metadata. The Browser we use sends information about the display and the system we use. 
If we use services like Facebook or Instagram, the Pictures contain a lot of metadata about the camera, the time when we took the photo and sometimes even the GPS data. 

Even if we don’t leave any traces (highly unlikely) there are still some unique ways to find you.
Your mouse movements can tell a lot about you (mouseTrackingAnalysis) and even the way you use a webpage can be quite unique. 
And even if we can avoid getting tracked, most of the things we do in the online world have some consequences in the real world, for example payment methods. Even if we use a service as Bitcoin to keep out payment methods a secret, to use the money, it has to enter the real world.
