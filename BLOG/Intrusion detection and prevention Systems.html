If we have an intruder or a malicious software in your system, we have just a few options to detect it. One way to do so would be to log the activities in our network. To automate this, we use IDS - Intrusion Detection System.
An IDS will scan your network and set a normal state, that moment, when your system is working normally. If there are changes in the detected state or we find irregular behaviour in the system, for example if there is way more traffic than usual, we know that something is not working correctly, or someone/something is using the network in a way that is unwanted. 
Another way to detect malicious behaviour is Extrusion Detection. With this, the IDS will focus on system activity and outgoing traffic to identify malicious user or malware who try to export data. [4]

If the IDS finds something irregular, it will inform the system administrator, and log the specific thread. Some IDS will even try to get more information about the attacker.
IDS can be classified in many different ways, such as their location in the system and their architecture. We have chosen four of the most used types to present: 
The Network-IDS will gain access to the network traffic and build up sensors at choke points to monitor the stream. The Host-based-IDS will place its sensors on the machines themselves, most in the form of user agents. The Perimeter-IDE will use perimeters to detect behaviour. If a perimeter is breached, the system calls alarm. A VM-IDE detects intrusion by using VM Machine Monitoring. [5]

An IDS can use many different techniques to scan the network. A computer system will log all problems, errors or other information in so called log files. The IDS will check them for irregularities. This method doesn’t belong to a specific category, because log files are generated by every machine of the network. However, we would mostly use it with Host-Based-IDS. 
A second method would be to scan all packages that go through the network. This can slow the network down, which is why we wouldn’t check every package but would choose randomly.

<br><br>

An IPS is a more active version of an IDS. It will start countermeasures if it detects an intruder.

<br><br>

There are a few ways to search for intruders, such as Anomaly detection, signature detection and stateful protocol analysis detection. Anomaly detection searches for abnormal behaviour of the system, while signature detection is searching for patterns in the normal state and compares them. The stateful protocol analysis detection searches for missuses of protocols.

<br><br>

Free examples for an IDS are Suricata or Snort. Snort has IPS capabilities as well.
Snort will analyse the network traffic and search for signs of malicious behaviour. You can define rules by yourself or use a plugin to do so. Snort is a Network-IDS. [6]
